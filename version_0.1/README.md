# DocBiasO
DocBiasO is an ontology-driven approach to support the documentation of bias in data.

The Doc-BiasO Ontology is serialized in RDF/XML syntax (docbias-schema.owl) and Turtle (docbias-schema.ttl).

The file (trustworthy_alignment.owl) contains the alignment study performed on AIRO and FMO ontologies.
